<h2>Intro to Programming - Lesson 1</h2>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<body>

Content – what you see<br>
Markup – what it looks like<br>
References to other docs —like images/video<br>
Links to other pages<br>
<h3>HTML Markup</h3>
Plain text is plain text<br>
Markup is made up of tags <br>
Opening tag has brackets<br>
Closing tag has / and brackets <br>
Opening + closing tags = element<br>
b tag – bold <br>
em tag – emphasis – italics<br>

<h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
Attributes always = value<br>
Can have multiple attributes<br>
Anchor tag = a in brackets and it's for making links<br>
href=attribute name<br>
Value =url<br>
Contents – derp<br>
images=img in brackets<br>
Src =source<br>
Alt = text if image doesn’t load<br>
Images don’t have a closing tag – because it has no content<br>

<h3>Whitespace</h3>
To make text on multiple lines add a break tag<br>
This is a void tag – no need for closing tag<br>
Paragraph tag can also be used and it is a block tag --which means there's an invisible block around it.<br>
<h3>Inline vs Block</h3>
The break tag is inline and so is <b>bold (b)</b>, <em>italics (em)</em>, and image (img)<br>
P tag is block … makes an invisibile box<br>
A box that can be resized/shaped around the first p tagged text<br>
Span is inline<br>
Div is block<br>
<h3>HTML Documents</h3>
In brackets with ! is the fact that it's an HTML doc<br>
An opening tag and closing tag to surrounds the document html and then /html<br>
Next is a head tag: meta data and other stuff, like if you want to use Javascript or CSS<br>
Then a Title tag – which appears in your browser window as title<br>
After title close your head tag<br>
Then Body which is where we'll spend the bulk of time in this class<br>
The tag here is "body"<br>
And then don't forget to close the whole document with /html tag

<h3>MUST TAKEAWAYS from Lesson 1:</h3>
<h4>(COPIED DIRECTLY FROM SCREEN but modified to not have everything in bold)</h4>
<p><b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</p>
<p>
<b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
look like this:
I'm learning to code!
</p>
<p>
<b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
For example, if you forget to close a b<b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.</b> This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
</p>
<p>
<b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
</p>
<p>
<b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<br>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (p in brackets for example) and a closing tag, (/p). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the break tag).
<br>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set thehref attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write the following in angle brackets (a href="www.udacity.com")
